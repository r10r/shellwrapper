# Introduction

Shellwrapper is a simple wrapper for shell command executions.

It should help to minimize the effort when interacting
with external programs that run in a shell.

A command execution returns a result object that
wraps the  STDOUT and STDERR output of the executed command.

# Installation

Shellwrapper uses buildr as build system.
In order to install shellwrapper into your local maven 
repository you must have buildr installed [buildr](http://buildr.apache.org)
and run
<pre>
  buildr install
</pre>
in the project directory.
The installed library can then be included in any project that 
uses artifacts from the local maven repository. For buildr 
you would add the line:
<pre>
  define 'myproject' do
    ...
    compile.with 'de.entwicklerland:shellwrapper:jar:0.2'
    ...
  end
</pre>

# HOWTO

Shellwrapper is very easy to use.
I'm to lazy to add a separate documentation here ;-)
So please have a look at the tests.
They are most suitable to learn how to use the shellwrapper.
